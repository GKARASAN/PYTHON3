''' you can change in any type str , int , float , bool and more type's '''

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

int()   - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str()   - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals
